# SurvivalBot-AI<br>
A behaviour tree based AI which will try to survive as long as possible

This was an exam assignment where we had to build an AI that could survive an onslaught of zombies
while scavenging for food and supplies.

## Logic<br>
The entire AI was built using a custom Behaviour Tree setup allowing for a clear, easy to read and
easy to maintain system.


## Challenges<br>
The main challenge in this project was to create a behaviour tree exhibiting complex and intelligent
behaviour without making the tree too deep as the framework provided was unable to handle a tree that had too many levels of depth.

# DISCLAIMER<br>
Parts of this project code was provided by HoWest Digital Arts and Entertainment (DAE) as they provided the framework
in which the AI was built. If you specifically wish to find my code. Look for the behaviour classes and the Survivor classes.
All rights and any form of ownership of this code goes to DAE.
